# odin-recipes
The "Recipes" project is designed to put all of the aquired HTML knowledge to practice,
creating a simple website, which consists of a main index page and several links to individual pages with recipes.

Several programming skills will have been demonstrated: creating an html-document with a simple structure, creating links, placing images on the page.
